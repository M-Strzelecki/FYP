# A Machine Learning Approach to Nutritional Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide an automated solution for nutritional analysis using machine learning techniques. It features a mobile application that uses barcode scanning to retrieve and analyze nutritional data, categorizing food products into health-conscious clusters. The application leverages machine learning models to simplify nutritional information, making it accessible and understandable for users.

## Features

- **Barcode Scanning:** Instantly retrieve detailed product information from Open Food Facts.
- **Nutritional Clustering:** Categorize products into clusters to help users make healthier food choices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with Flutter for compatibility with both Android and iOS devices.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes various visual tools such as word clouds, bar graphs, and PCA heatmaps for better understanding.

## Goals and Objectives

### Simplify Access to Nutritional Information
- Use barcode scanning for quick data retrieval.
- Provide detailed product information instantly.

### Deliver Dietary Recommendations
- Implement clustering models to analyze and categorize nutritional data.
- Aid users in making healthier food choices.

### Enhance User Experience
- Ensure the app operates efficiently across multiple devices.
- Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Technical Details

### Mobile Application Development
- **Framework:** Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Barcode Scanning:** Integration with a high-performance barcode scanning library.
- **API:** Uses Open Food Facts API for product data retrieval.

### Machine Learning Model
- **Data Analysis:** Initially developed in Python for data preprocessing.
- **Model Development:** Uses K-Means clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **On-Device Execution:** Converted to PyTorch for integration into the mobile app.

### Data Visualization
- **Clusters Visualization:** PCA to visualize clusters.
- **Word Clouds:** Generated from NLP results to identify common words from product names.
- **Heatmaps:** Show feature contributions to principal components.
